<h1>Calf Research</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Calf Research page. This page highlights our work on predicting body weight and detecting diarrhea in calves using advanced machine learning techniques such as YOLOv8 and threshold-based segmentation methods.</p>

<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>YOLOv8 for object detection</li>
  <li>Body weight prediction</li>
  <li>Diarrhea detection</li>
</ul>
